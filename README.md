Spam Email Detection Project

This project aims to build a simple spam email detection model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The implementation is done in Python using the scikit-learn library.

#Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

#Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

#Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

spam_filter.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for importing packages, loading data, and training the spam email detection model.
spam.csv: Dataset containing labeled spam and ham (non-spam) emails.
Usage
You can use this project as a starting point for building a spam email detection system. The provided Jupyter notebook guides you through the process of loading data, preprocessing, training the model, and testing it with sample emails.

Feel free to modify the code or integrate it into your own applications as needed.
